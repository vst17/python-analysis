•	A Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. Given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

•	A Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period
